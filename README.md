# SNMP Integration for Monitoring Systems

This repository contains a Python-based script designed to integrate SNMP data with monitoring systems like PRTG. The script demonstrates core concepts in SNMP integration, device querying, and monitoring data representation, with a focus on educational and illustrative purposes.

## Features

- **Device Information Query:**
  Retrieves device metrics such as VSAT IDs, MAC addresses, and network performance indicators using SNMP protocols.

- **PRTG Integration:**
  Generates output in a format compatible with PRTG's custom sensor system.

- **Error Handling:**
  Handles invalid inputs or missing data gracefully, ensuring robust operation.

- **Mock Implementation:**
  Includes mocked SNMP responses to simulate functionality without requiring proprietary system access.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/snmp-monitoring-integration.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snmp-monitoring-integration
   ```

3. Run the script with test input:
   ```bash
   python script.py '{"params": "OID:MAC_ADDRESS"}'
   ```

   Replace `OID` and `MAC_ADDRESS` with placeholder values to test the mock implementation.

## Key Changes for GitHub Compliance

To ensure this script is suitable for public sharing, the following changes were made:

1. **Abstracted IP Addresses:**
   - Proprietary IP addresses have been replaced with generic placeholders (`192.168.x.x`).

2. **Generic OIDs:**
   - Real OIDs have been replaced with generic placeholders (`.1.3.6.1.4.1.xxxx`).

3. **Mock SNMP Responses:**
   - Actual SNMP commands and responses have been replaced with mock implementations to simulate functionality without exposing proprietary data.

4. **Removed Proprietary Context:**
   - Eliminated references to specific systems and replaced them with neutral terms like `devices`.

5. **Simplified Data Logic:**
   - Placeholder data (e.g., `VSAT_ID`, `MAC_ADDRESS`) is used instead of real-world device identifiers.

6. **Generalized Comments:**
   - Comments have been revised to avoid referencing proprietary systems or internal processes, keeping them neutral and educational.

7. **Focus on Educational Value:**
   - Structured the code to showcase general SNMP integration concepts, making it clear that the script is illustrative and not directly deployable.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided for **educational and illustrative purposes only**. It does not include proprietary or confidential information and cannot be used for commercial purposes or in real-world deployments without significant modification.

By sharing this repository, I aim to demonstrate the core principles of SNMP integration in monitoring systems while ensuring compliance with intellectual property and confidentiality obligations. Any resemblance to proprietary systems is purely coincidental and intentional abstraction has been applied to avoid commercial conflicts.
